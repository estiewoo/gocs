# 2. Summary

This GOC is intended to describe the tasks involved in managing the Graph AdvocatesDAO Twitter account. The explained tasks pertaining to Twitter management also contain specific rules and/or guidelines in order to deliver a consistent external branding of the DAO. 

<br>

# 3. Motivation

Twitter is a vital tool for enhancing awareness of the DAO and its mission. Management of the Twitter account will be conducted in a decentralized method that enables multiple DAO members to engage in the process. It is therefore necessary to specify rules of engagement with sufficient enough details in order to deliver a consistent Twitter messaging output that is in line with the DAO’s mission.

# 4. Specification

## 4.1. Scope of Engagement
The Graph AdvocatesDAO’s mission is to grow The Graph and web3 ecosystem. Tweets sent from the DAO Twitter account should therefore aim to support fulfilling that mission and not deviate into unrelated topics. That also extends to questions such as which other accounts the DAO Twitter account should follow. 

### 4.1.1. Content
The following is a list of content types that the DAO should adhere to tweeting about:

* The Graph ecosystem and protocol updates
* Graph AdvocatesDAO member stories
* Graph Advocates success stories
* Graph community grantee spotlights
* Web3 ecosystem developments
* DAO tooling, best practices, thought leadership

### 4.1.2. Account Following
The Graph AdvocatesDAO strives to be a spotlight in the Graph ecosystem, which is also reflected by the accounts it follows. The following is a guide of the type of accounts that are generally favored to be followed:

* Graph AdvocatesDAO members
* Grantees
* Graph Advocates
* Reputable Graph community members
* Web3 protocols
* Web3 icons
* Other DAOs

The Graph AdvocatesDAO’s mission should be an overarching guideline. Web3 participants and protocols that are considered pioneers in the ecosystem should be considered to follow. Likewise, participants in web3 that are demonstrating not to be mission-aligned should be avoided, such as individuals engaging in frequent price talks, airdrops or giveaways, as well as protocols that are not showing authentic commitment to decentralization.


## 4.2. Tweet Process


### 4.2.1. Pipeline Management
Anyone may suggest ideas for content to be tweeted, re-tweeted or quote tweeted (“tweets”). However, all tweets shall be drafted, reviewed, approved, and released by the Twitter team that oversees the Graph AdvocatesDAO Twitter account. A workflow management system should be used to manage the tweets pipeline proficiently that enables scalable methods of creating and approving content, as well as scheduling tweets efficiently. 


### 4.2.2. Tweet Language
Managing a branded Twitter account, such as the Graph AdvocatesDAO, requires a more proficient and systematic approach than most individual Twitter accounts. Language and tone across tweets should be consistent regardless of the individuals engaged in creating the content. The Twitter team is responsible to establish Tweet Guidelines that inform team members on how to successfully execute on that mandate.


### 4.2.3. Tweet Cadence
Tweet volume and sequencing intervals are important elements to consider. Too few tweets may result in a lack of engagement by the account’s followers, while too many tweets may be perceived as spamming followers with too much content. The Twitter team shall establish guidelines for a target number of tweet volume and leverage the aforementioned pipeline management process to appropriately execute tweet activities.
